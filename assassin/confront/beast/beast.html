        <h1>Stealth Against the Formless</h1>
        <p>
            The Beast of Shadows, a creature of nightmares, moves with unnatural agility. Its formless body twists and turns, a patch of darker night against the shadowy room.
        </p>
        <p>
            You use your unparalleled stealth, blending into the darkness. The Beast's senses are keen, but you are a master of misdirection. You strike from the shadows, your attacks precise and lethal.
        </p>
        <p>
            In a final confrontation, you set a trap, using a rare alchemical concoction to reveal the Beast's core. As it materializes, you leap, daggers sinking into its heart of shadows, dissipating it into nothingness.
