        <h1>Agility Against Strength</h1>
        <p>
            The Dark Knight stands before you, a behemoth clad in shadowed armor. He wields a sword that could cleave stone. Your agility and cunning are your greatest weapons against his brute strength.
        </p>
        <p>
            You dart in and out of his reach, your blades leaving trails of silver in the air. Each time he swings his massive sword, you're a ghost, a wisp of smoke that he cannot catch.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the Knight grows weary, you find an opening. With a flurry of swift strikes, you target the chinks in his armor. He stumbles, falls, and the ground shakes upon his defeat.
