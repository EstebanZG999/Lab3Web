        <h1>The Elusive Battle with the Dark Knight</h1>
        <p>
            The Dark Knight, a giant clad in menacing armor, patrols the area. His movements are heavy and loud, a stark contrast to your silent steps. You use the environment to your advantage, staying out of sight.

            As he swings his massive sword, you duck and weave through his defenses. Your attacks are quick and targeted, aiming for the gaps in his armor. The Knight's strength is formidable, but his speed is no match for yours.

            Finally, you launch a series of blindingly fast strikes, each one a critical hit. The Dark Knight staggers, weakened by your relentless assault, and falls defeated, a testament to your stealth and skill.
