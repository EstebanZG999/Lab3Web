            <img src="../../Imagenes/warlock.png" alt="Mystical Warlock" >
            <p>The Warlock's magic is potent, but his focus on sorcery makes him blind to your stealthy approach. A silent takedown may be possible.</p>

            <img src="../../Imagenes/beast.png" alt="Beast of Shadows">
            <p>The Beast of Shadows, a creature of pure darkness, eludes even the keenest of eyes. Its formless nature makes it a unique and dangerous adversary.</p>
