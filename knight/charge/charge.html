            With the determination of steel, you mount your steed, rallying the knights around you. The time for defense has passed; you will meet your foes head-on, in a thunderous charge that will decide the fate of Eldoria.

                The code of the Knights of Aetheria holds bravery above all virtues, for a knight must be the first into battle and the last to leave it.

            Hooves pound the earth as you and your fellow knights break through the enemy lines, your blade a whirlwind of death. Men shout and fall, but your focus is singular - the enemy commander must fall by your hand.
