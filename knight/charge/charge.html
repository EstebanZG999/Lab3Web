        <p>As the dust and turmoil of battle settle, an ominous silence descends upon the field. From the enemy's ranks, three shadowy figures emerge, each exuding a menacing aura of power.</p>

            <h2>Final Confrontation</h2>
            <p>The Warlock, with his arcane fires, would be a natural prey for your Sorcerer allies, but for you, he presents a dangerous enigma. His spells are deadly and his malice palpable.</p>
            <p>The Dark Knight, your mirror in so many ways, strides forward with a grim determination. His strength is legendary, his skill with the blade unmatched except, perhaps, by your own.</p>
            <p>The Beast of Shadows is a terror, a formless nightmare that even the stealthiest of Assassins would dread facing. Its presence alone chills your soul.</p>
