            <h2>Battle of Legends</h2>
            <p>The Warlock, though a formidable foe for a Sorcerer, could be vulnerable to a direct assault. His reliance on magic is his weakness.</p>
            <p>The Dark Knight is your equal in combat, a mirror of your own martial prowess. This battle will be one for the ages.</p>
            <p>The Beast of Shadows is an entity of pure malice, a foe that even the most skilled Assassin would fear. Its ethereal nature makes it a challenging opponent.</p>
