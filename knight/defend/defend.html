            The siege had begun at dawn. As you don your armor, the clanging of metal and the shouts of men fill the air, a cacophony of war that drowns out the fear in your heart. You're a Knight of Aetheria; this is your duty, your honor.

            You reach the wall to see a ladder clank against the stone, an enemy's head appearing over the rim. With a roar, you smash it away with your shield, sending the invader falling into the abyss below.

            More ladders follow, and with them, the relentless tide of adversaries. You fight with the ferocity of a lion, each swing of your blade a sentence of death for those who dare climb the sacred walls of Eldoria.
