        <p>After unraveling the source of the disturbance, you are confronted by three powerful enemies: a Warlock, a Dark Knight, and the Beast of Shadows. Each represents a unique challenge to your magical abilities.</p>

            <h2>Decisive Encounters</h2>
            <p>The Warlock, with his dark spells, is a formidable enemy for any sorcerer. His knowledge of dark magic is extensive, but perhaps his arrogance is his weakness.</p>
            <p>The Dark Knight, clad in heavy armor, is more vulnerable to your enchantments. His close combat skills will not be of much use against your powerful spells.</p>
            <p>The Beast of Shadows, an ethereal creature, is resistant to physical attacks but susceptible to your arcane magic. Facing this entity of pure darkness will be a challenge.</p>
