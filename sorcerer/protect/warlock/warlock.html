        <h1>Battle of Arcane Masters</h1>
        <p>
            Amidst the chaos, the Warlock emerges as your primary adversary, his aura seething with dark energy. With the townspeople behind you, you stand as their protector, your staff aglow with the power of light and protection.

            The Warlock unleashes a torrent of shadow magic. You counter with a barrier of radiant energy, protecting the innocent and reflecting his dark spells. The air crackles with the clash of light and dark.

            As the Warlock grows frustrated, his attacks become more frenzied. You see an opening and unleash a spell of binding light, entwining the Warlock in luminous chains. With a focused burst of magical energy, you break his concentration, causing his dark powers to dissipate.
